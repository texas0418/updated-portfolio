            I was born in December of 1970 in San Antonio, Texas. My parents moved us to
            the Clear Lake part of Houston not long after I was born, where I spend most of
            my childhood. I quit school my freshman year of high school and got my GED the year
            after and ended up at a trade school in Waco, Texas, where I got an associate’s degree in
            computer maintenance.

            My work career is extensive and in different areas as I could not keep
            a job and moved around a lot. I worked as a computer technician, graphic designer, in
            restaurants, in bars, sales, and presently in the oil and gas industry. Recently I
            decided that my career path wasn’t one I wanted to continue to follow, so I decided to
            go back to school for coding and cybersecurity.

            I have many hobbies, but ultimately, I enjoy learned and building. The
            Raspberry Pi has opened up a whole new world of possibilities and I just completed my
            Smart Mirror build. I also make RetroPie gaming systems with the Pi board. My other
            hobbies include collecting comics; mostly graded and key issues. Building and modifying
            motorcycle; I am presently working on a cafe racer based on an old 1978 Honda CB750K
            frame. And one of my next projects is building a home server lab to help with getting
            my cybersecurity certification.
